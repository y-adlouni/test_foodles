1) Write a function that takes as input (sentence: String, n: Number)
and returns a list of size `n` where each element contains a word and and the frequency of that word in `sentence`
This list should be sorted by decreasing frequency and alphabetical order in case of tie.

Example:
```text
Input: ("bar baz foo foo zblah zblah zblah baz toto bar", 3)
```
Output:
```text
[
   ("zblah", 3),
   ("bar", 2),
   ("baz", 2),
]
```

2) Write tests for the function you just wrote
